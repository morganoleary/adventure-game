## Bugs & Errors

- Commit #80f00d8 was meant to read as follows: "Add functions to story  when user chooses earth"
    - I accidentally pushed the commit without realizing my error of stating "mars" again so I researched on how to change a previous commit message. 
    - I used Slack and this [GitHub Doc](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/changing-a-commit-message) to try to amend the issue with "git rebase -i HEAD~n". This became increasingly confusing.
    - Tutor support was contacted and advised that -'Having an incorrect message is a much smaller problem than trying to change your commit.'- and everything should be working normally, but that Codeanywhere seemed to have a glitch as I wasn't able to save new updates and use the advised "git push --force" command. I was then told to create a new workspace and I was up and running again. 
    - I was not able to rename the commit message and was advised to add a note to my README file.
